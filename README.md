# News-Web-App
## What is The Project About
Developed a news application that allows users to view and search for news topics across many categories. For this application I used HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Express, NodeJS, and [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
## How The Project Works
The news categories available for viewing are general, business, science, technology, and health. Each page populates the news article with important information about the articles. View the entire article on the actual news source.
